A polymeter runs two or more different meters at once (e.g., 4/4 against 5/4). Unlike polyrhythm (different subdivisions inside the same bar), polymeter uses different loop lengths, so parts realign only after a number of beats equal to the least common multiple of the meters.

Core idea
- Each part has its own bar length (e.g., 4 vs 5). They share the same tempo but cycle over different spans.
- The composite groove evolves every bar; full alignment happens at the LCM (e.g., 4/4 vs 5/4 realigns every 20 beats).

Programming approach
- Set independent clip/loop lengths (e.g., 16 steps vs 20 steps) and start them together.
- Use distinct accent maps per meter so each part “speaks” its own meter clearly.
- Keep an anchor (steady kick or drone) to make the shifting emphasis feel intentional.

Musical effect
- Subtle long‑form evolution ideal for ambient/techno.
- A sense of drifting phase without changing tempo or using different BPMs.
- Great with Euclidean or clave‑inspired lines riding against a fixed 4/4 backbone.

Examples (16‑step)

- Overlay of 4‑step and 5‑step loop starts across 16 steps:
  - 4‑step cycle starts: 1,5,9,13
  - 5‑step cycle starts: 1,6,11,16
