A polymeter runs two or more different meters at once (e.g., 4/4 against 5/4). Unlike polyrhythm (different subdivisions inside the same bar), polymeter uses different loop lengths, so parts realign only after a number of beats equal to the least common multiple of the meters.

Core idea
- Each part has its own bar length (e.g., 4 vs 5). They share the same tempo but cycle over different spans.
- The composite groove evolves every bar; full alignment happens at the LCM (e.g., 4/4 vs 5/4 realigns every 20 beats).

Programming approach
- Set independent clip/loop lengths (e.g., 16 steps vs 20 steps) and start them together.
- Use distinct accent maps per meter so each part “speaks” its own meter clearly.
- Keep an anchor (steady kick or drone) to make the shifting emphasis feel intentional.

Musical effect
- Subtle long‑form evolution ideal for ambient/techno.
- A sense of drifting phase without changing tempo or using different BPMs.
- Great with Euclidean or clave‑inspired lines riding against a fixed 4/4 backbone.
Examples

- Choose the two loop lengths, optionally extend the grid (16 or 20 steps) to watch their resolution point, and rotate either loop to see how emphasis shifts even though both lines keep cycling at the same BPM.
