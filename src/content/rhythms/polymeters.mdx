A polymeter is the simultaneous use of two or more different time signatures. While polyrhythm layers rhythms with different subdivisions within the same time signature, a polymeter layers entire meters. For example, one part of the music could be in 4/4 time while another is in 3/4 time.

This creates a fascinating rhythmic tension as the downbeats of the different meters only align periodically. The example below demonstrates a 3 against 4 polymeter. One voice plays a pattern of 4 beats, while the other plays a pattern of 3 beats. The two patterns start together, and then cycle, realigning on the downbeat every 12 beats (the least common multiple of 3 and 4).
