import PulseGeneratorExplorer from '../../components/rhythms/PulseGeneratorExplorer.tsx';

The pulse generator is a compact rhythmic engine: hold a chord, pick a pattern, and let the pulses carve groove.
It is especially useful for testing ostinatos, action beds, and syncopated chord stabs without committing to
a full sequencer lane.

What to listen for
- Accent shapes: compare accent patterns, ramp modes, and fixed velocity to feel how emphasis changes the groove.
- Rate vs swing: keep the same pattern, then switch rate multipliers and swing to shift the pocket.
