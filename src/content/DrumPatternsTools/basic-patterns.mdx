and export a General MIDI file (channel 10 kit mapping).

- Patterns stay grouped under their original section headers and page numbers.
- Playback uses 16th notes; adjust BPM and flip any step before exporting.
- GM drums: BD 36, SN 38, RS 37, CL 39, CH 42, OH 46, CY 49, CB 56, LT 45, MT 47, HT 50, SH 82, HC 63, LC 64, AC 57.
