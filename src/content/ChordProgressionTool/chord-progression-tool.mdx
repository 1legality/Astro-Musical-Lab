## Input Syntax Cheat Sheet

- Separate chords with spaces: `Cmaj7 Dm7 G7`.
- Append durations with `:` in bars using decimal numbers (`0.5`, `1.5`, etc.) or ticks (`T192`) for absolute control.
- Add slash chords (`F/A`), single notes with octaves (`C#3`), or rests (`R:0.5`).
- Change feels fast by requesting fresh progressions from an LLM or your own notes; just paste, tweak, then preview.

## Workflow Tips

1. **Set the vibe** – Give the tool a short description when prompting your favorite AI assistant (e.g., “deep dub techno
   pad progression, 16 bars”) and paste the returned chords.
2. **Choose the voicing recipe** – Toggle between chords only, chords + bass, or bass alone, and pick the inversion logic
   (root, smooth, or wide) plus base octave.
3. **Preview + loop** – Use the on-page synth to audition the sequence, click any chord button for spot-checking, and fine
   tune durations or velocity until it grooves with your rhythmic system.
4. **Export deliverables** – Click Download MIDI for DAW work, Export PDF for printable charts, or Copy Share URL when you
   want to send someone else the exact settings.
